React.js
===

## Getting started with React.js
- SPA: faster but more complex; render pieces of the webpage using components; use data immutablity to avoid complexity
- getInitalState: function returning object that sets inital state for component; this.state.stateName to access state attr;
- use single brackets to interpolate state into render function with JSX e.g., { this.state.stateName }
- In Console: set state with reactComponent.setState( stateName: attr ); get state with reactComponent.state()
